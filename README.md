## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | FastAPI, Socket.IO, Python 3.12 |
| ML | River (Online Learning), NumPy, Custom Kalman |
| Real-Time | Server-Sent Events, WebSocket |
| Deployment | Railway, HuggingFace Spaces |
| Data | Discord API, Custom Scraping |

## 📊 Performance

- ⚡ **Sub-10ms** trade-to-UI latency
- 🔄 **Zero polling** - pure event-driven
- 💾 **O(1) memory** ML updates
- 📈 **55 Railway deployments**

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Built custom Online ML pipeline** with ADWIN drift detection
2. **Implemented HFT-style architecture** with manual GC for latency control
3. **Created real-time Discord integration** for trade monitoring
4. **Designed volume-clock sampling** for Gaussian price distributions
